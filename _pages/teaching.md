### Project

- Problem/Project-based Learning (APP): Proposal and supervision of a student project (3rd-4th year of engineering education) in collaboration with [CREA](https://creamontblanc.org/en) (Altitude Ecosystem Research Center).
  Autonomous System SCAR (Snow Cover & Animal Recognition):
  - Physical measurements acquisition (temperature, humidity & brightness)
  - Image acquisition + processing (object detection, snow/greenery ratio)
  - Information transmission via LoRaWAN protocol
  - Real-time visualization of a set of indicators

### Internships

- 4th-year engineering education internship: Snow segmentation on webcam images.<br /> 
[The project on Github](https://github.com/AlexandreProthin/SegmentationNeige/)
- Bachelor's degree internship (Brazil collaboration): Change detection classification at multiple spatial scales in SAR images. <br />
